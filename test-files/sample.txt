This is a sample text file for testing the new multi-format import functionality.

The TypeShift app now supports:
- Plain text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)

You can use this file to test the text import functionality. Try importing different file formats and see how the text is extracted and displayed in the preview section.

Features implemented:
1. File validation (size limits, format checking)
2. Loading states with toast notifications
3. Error handling for corrupted or unsupported files
4. Enhanced user feedback with file type descriptions
5. Automatic text history saving before import
